# Nerdle

Nerdle is a clone of [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), the
word guessing game. To play, enter a five-letter English word.

Unlike the original Wordle, Nerdle runs on the server instead of in the browser, making it
impossible to cheat. It uses <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> and cookies to submit data, meaning you can
even play with JavaScript disabled!
